# Eupnea

Eupnea is a crucial software component designed to efficiently monitor and streamline data derived from the Proxmox API. Built with an emphasis on security and performance, it serves as an intermediary, processing data for presentation through a frontend.

## Backend: The Heart of Data Processing

The backend's primary responsibility is to interface with the Proxmox API. It retrieves the required data, refines it, and then broadcasts it as a WebSocket stream. Here are some notable features and design considerations:

- **Secure Interactions**: Eupnea ensures secure transactions and data fetches from the Proxmox API, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
- **Optimized Data Processing**: The refinement process filters out noise and ensures that only the most pertinent information is passed along. This optimizes bandwidth and ensures faster data transmissions.
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Leveraging WebSocket technology, Eupnea guarantees real-time updates, which is crucial for monitoring systems.

## Frontend: Elegance Meets Efficiency

Once the backend broadcasts the data, the frontend takes charge. Built using SolidJS and UnoCSS, the frontend is both lightweight and visually appealing:

- **SolidJS Integration**: By harnessing the power of SolidJS, the frontend boasts reactive and efficient rendering. This ensures swift updates without taxing system resources.
- **UnoCSS Styling**: UnoCSS, known for its utility-first approach, helps in crafting an intuitive and clean user interface. The design ethos is simple: make data visualization both beautiful and understandable.
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: The frontend fetches data in real-time from the WebSocket endpoint, ensuring users always have access to the most recent data.
